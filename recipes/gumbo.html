            <li>1 fine diced jalapeno (seedless for no heat)</li>
            <li>1 whole bulb of garlic. Not just clove</li>
            <li>1 diced onion (yellow or white)</li>
            <li>6 sliced Okra</li>
            <li>1/2 cup high temp oil</li>
            <li>1/2 cup all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>4-6 cups chicken stock</li>

        <h3>Steps:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Mise en Place. Prepare all ingredients before beginning to cook</li>
            <li>Season chicken and cook until browned on both sides</li>
            <li>In a large pot, prepare a roux using the oil and flour. Get the oil smoking hot on at least medium-high heat, then add flour. Stir until roux is brown</li>
            <li>Once roux is ready, add in all the prepared vegetables except for the garlic. Mix and stir the vegetables for about 5 minutes, or until the onion is transluscent. Add garlic in last and stir for around 30 seconds</li>
            <li>Turn heat to low-medium and pour in the beer. Add in 1 cup of chciken stock if it becomes too thick. Stir the mixture and scrape fond off the sides and bottom of pot. Cook for about 5 minutes so alcohol can burn out, then pour in 3 cups of stock (or as much for your perfect consistency)</li>
            <li>Set heat to low. Chop up the meat and stir into pot. Add spices and bay leaves. Let simmer until dark in color</li>
        </ol>
